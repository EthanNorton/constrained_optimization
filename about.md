Adding a new file to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) impact on K-nearest neighbors (KNNs)in order to evaluate null variables, and if they should be omitted. 

Specifically, interested if patterns can be detected from a hue of severity scores for KNNs impact on false positives of CNNs. Are false positive insertations of CNN to KNN positions common?

Great start. Now, need some math.
